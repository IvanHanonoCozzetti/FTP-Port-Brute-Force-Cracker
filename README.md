## FTP Port Brute Force Cracker

#### Simple but effective script for FTP port cracking by using a Brute-Force attack.

### FTP
The File Transfer Protocol is a standard network protocol used for the transfer of computer files between a client and server on a computer network.
FTP is built on a client-server model architecture using separate control and data connections between the client and the server.
FTP users may authenticate themselves with a clear-text sign-in protocol, normally in the form of a username and password, but can connect anonymously if the server is configured to allow it. For secure transmission that protects the username and password, and encrypts the content, FTP is often secured with SSL/TLS (FTPS) or replaced with SSH File Transfer Protocol (SFTP).
